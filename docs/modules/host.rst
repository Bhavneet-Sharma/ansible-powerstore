Synopsis
--------

Managing host on PowerStore storage system includes create host with a set of initiators, add/remove initiators from host, rename host and delete host.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- A Dell PowerStore Storage System. Ansible 2.12, 2.13 or 2.14



Parameters
----------

  host_name (optional, str, None)
    The host name. This value must contain 128 or fewer printable Unicode characters.

    Creation of an empty host is not allowed.

    Required when creating a host.

    Use either host_id or host_name for modify and delete tasks.


  host_id (False, str, None)
    The 36 character long host id automatically generated when a host is created.

    Use either host_id or host_name for modify and delete tasks.

    The host_id cannot be used while creating host, as it is generated by the array after creation of host.

    It is to be mentioned in seconds.


  port (optional, int, None)

    If not passed, it will take 443 as default.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Only completely and correctly configured iSCSI initiators can be associated with a host.
   - The parameters initiators and detailed_initiators are mutually exclusive.
   - For mutual CHAP authentication, single CHAP credentials are mandatory.
   - Support of NVMe type of initiators is for PowerStore 2.0 and beyond.
   - The host_connectivity is supported only in PowerStore 3.0.0.0 and above.
   - The check_mode is not supported.
   - The modules present in this collection named as 'dellemc.powerstore' are built to support the Dell PowerStore storage platform.
